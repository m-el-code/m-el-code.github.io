                    Hello!! I'm Manar Elbeshbishy, and am currently in my third year studying Computer Science at Toronto Metropolitan University. 
                    I'm a dedicated Computer Science student with a passion for programming and problem-solving. 
                    I look forward to joining the workforce and applying my skills to the real-world.
                    Outside of programming, I enjoy gaming, reading, staying active, baking and spending time with friends and family.
